libthorax is intended to be a programming lingua franca for common and simple 
operations in project8 analysis.  it is written in ANSI C99, with no bells or
whistles.  

The aim is to reduce programmer/analyst error by providing an agreed-upon method
for doing things like converting a digital value to an analog one, or 
calculating the correct normalization prefactor for an FFTW3 power spectrum.

The Git workflow used is git-flow:

We suggest that you use the aptly-named git extension, git-flow, which is available from commonly-used package managers:
* https://github.com/nvie/gitflow

This is a preliminary list of functionality that the library has or will have:

* digital to analog (done)
* analog to digital (done)
* time calculations (done)
* fftw3 voltage normalization (not done)
* fftw3 power spectrum normalization (dBm and dBW) (not done)
* common power conversions (dBm, dBW, etc to mW, W) (not done)
* calibrations for cernox sensors, platinum sensors, power diode, etc (not done)
